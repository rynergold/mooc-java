Encryption algorithms, machine learning and making computer games less predictable all require randomness.
We can model randomness using random numbers. Java offers ready-made `Random` class for creating random numbers.
An instance of the Random class can be used as follows:

```java
import java.util.Random;

public class Raffle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Random ladyLuck = new Random(); // create Random object ladyLuck

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            // Draw and print a random number
            int randomNumber = ladyLuck.nextInt(10);
            System.out.println(randomNumber);
        }
    }
}
```

Above we create an instance of the `Random`class. It has `nextInt` method, which gets an integer as a parameter. The method returns a random number between `[0, integer[` or *0..(integer -1)*.

The program output is not always the same. One possible output is the following:

**Sample Output**
```text
2
2
4
3
4
5
6
0
7
8
```

### Programming Exercise: Numbers

Write a program that prompts the user for how many random numbers should be generated and then prints the numbers. The printed numbers should be within the range `[0, 10]`. Below are some examples.

**Sample Output**
```text
How many random numbers should be printed?
**4**
9
1
4
3
```

**Sample Output**
```text
How many random numbers should be printed?
**8**
9
6
0
9
10
7
3
3
```

We can use the `nextInt` method to create diverse randomness.
For example, we might need a program to give us a temperature between [-30,50].
We can do this by first creating random a number between 0 and 80 and then subtracting 30 from it.

```java
Random weatherMan = new Random();
int temperature = weatherMan.nextInt(81) - 30;
System.out.println(temperature);
```

### Programming Exercise: Die

The exercise template contains a class `Die`, which has the following body:

```java
import java.util.Random;

public class Die {
    private Random random;
    private int numberOfFaces;

    public Die(int numberOfFaces) {
        this.random = new Random();
        // Initialize the value of numberOfFaces here
    }

    public int throwDie() {
        // generate a random number which may be any number
        // between one and the number of faces, and then return it
    }
}
```

Modify the class, such that the constructor `Die(int numberOfFaces)` creates a new die-object with the given number of faces (i.e. the number of "sides" with a number). Also, modify the method `throwDie` so it returns the result of a random throw of the die, which should be a value withing the range `1 ... number of faces`.

The following is a main program for testing the die:

```java
public class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Die die = new Die(6);

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(die.throwDie());
        }
    }
}
```

The output could be as follows:

**Sample Output**
```text
1
6
3
5
3
3
2
2
6
1
```

A Random object can also be used to create random doubles. These can for example be used for calculating probabilities. Computers often simulate probabilities using doubles between [0..1].

The `nextDouble` method of the Random class creates random doubles.
Let's assume the weather follows these probabilities:

- There is 0.1 probability it rains (10%)
- There is 0.3 probability it snows (30%)
- There is 0.6 probability the sun shines (60%)

Let's create a weather forecast using these probabilities.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Random;

public class WeatherMan {
    private Random random;

    public WeatherMan() {
        this.random = new Random();
    }

    public String forecast() {
        double probability = this.random.nextDouble();

        if (probability <= 0.1) {
            return "It rains";
        } else if (probability <= 0.4) { // 0.1 + 0.3
            return "It snows";
        } else { // rest, 1.0 - 0.4 = 0.6
            return "The sun shines";
        }
    }

    public int makeAForecast() {
        return (int) (4 * this.random.nextGaussian() - 3);
    }
}
```

The `makeAForecast` method is interesting in many ways. The `this.random.nextGaussian()` call is a regular method call. However what is interesting is that this method of the `Random` class returns a normally distributed number (normally distributed numbers can be used to for example model the heights and weights of people -- if you are not interested in different kinds of randomness that is OK!).

```java
public int makeAForecast() {
    return (int) (4 * this.random.nextGaussian() - 3);
}
```

In the previous example we use explicit type casting to convert doubles to integers `(int)`.
We can equally convert integers to doubles with `(double) integer`.

Let's now add a main which uses the `WeatherMan` class.

```java
// imports

public class Program {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WeatherMan forecaster = new WeatherMan();

        // save days of the week to a list
        ArrayList<String> days = new ArrayList<>();
        days.add("Mon");
        days.add("Tue");
        days.add("Wed");
        days.add("Thu");
        days.add("Fri");
        days.add("Sat");
        days.add("Sun");

        System.out.println("Next week's weather forecast:");

        for (String day : days) {
            String weatherForecast = forecaster.forecast();
            int temperatureForecast = forecaster.makeAForecast();

            System.out.println(day + ": " + weatherForecast + " " + temperatureForecast + " degrees.");
        }
    }
}
```

The program output could be:

**Sample Output**
```text
Next week's weather forecast:
Mon: It snows 1 degrees.
Tue: It snows 1 degrees.
Wed: The sun shines -2 degrees.
Thu: The sun shines 0 degrees.
Fri: It snows -3 degrees.
Sat: It snows -3 degrees.
Sun: The sun shines -5 degrees
```

### Programming Exercise: Lottery

Your assignment is to complete the class `LotteryRow`, which is used to draw the week's winning numbers. The numbers are in range 1--40, and 7 numbers will be drawn in total. A lottery row consists of seven different numbers that are all in range 1--40.

We wish to implement the following functions in the class:

- the constructor `LotteryRow` creates a new LotteryRow object that contains new randomized numbers.

- the method `numbers` returns the drawn lottery numbers of this lottery row

- the method `containsNumber` tells whether the given number is included in the drawn numbers

- the method `randomizeNumbers` randomizes new numbers for the lottery row.

The basic structure of the class is as follows:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Random;

    public class LotteryRow {
    private ArrayList<Integer> numbers;

    public LotteryRow() {
        this.randomizeNumbers();
    }

    public ArrayList<Integer> numbers() {
        return this.numbers;
    }

    public boolean containsNumber(int number) {
        // Tests whether the number is already among the randomized numbers
        return false;
    }

    public void randomizeNumbers() {
        // initialize the list for numbers
        this.numbers = new ArrayList<>();
        // Implement the randomization of the numbers by using the method containsNumber() here
    }

    public boolean equals(Object other) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

The following main program is supplied in the exercise base:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LotteryRow row = new LotteryRow();
        ArrayList<Integer> lotteryNumbers = row.numbers();

        System.out.println("Lottery numbers:");
        for (int number: lotteryNumbers) {
            System.out.print(number + " ");
        }

        System.out.println("");
    }
}
```

Here are a few possible outputs of the program:

**Sample Output**
```text
Lottery numbers:
3 5 10 14 15 27 37
```

**Sample Output**
```text
Lottery numbers:
2 9 11 18 23 32 34
```

**NB!** The same number can only appear once in a lottery row. The numbers don't need to be ordered.
