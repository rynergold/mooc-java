Previously we have used one dimensional arrays, where the index tells us the location of a value in the only dimension.
We can also create multidimensional arrays. Then we need the indexes of a value in each dimension to access the value.
This comes handy when our data is multidimensional, for example when dealing with coordinates.

A two dimensional array with two rows and three columns can be created like so:

```java
int rows = 2;
int columns = 3;
int[][] twoDimensionalArray = new int[rows][columns];
```

In the array we created above, each row refers to an array with a certain number of columns.
We can iterate over a two dimensional array using two nested for loops like so:

```java
int rows = 2;
int columns = 3;
int[][] twoDimensionalArray = new int[rows][columns];

System.out.println("row, column, value");
for (int row = 0; row < twoDimensionalArray.length; row++) {
    for (int column = 0; column < twoDimensionalArray[row].length; column++) {
        int value = twoDimensionalArray[row][column];
        System.out.println("" + row + ", " + column + ", " + value);
    }
}
```

The program output is as follows:

**Sample Output**
```text
row, column, value
0, 0, 0
0, 1, 0
0, 2, 0
1, 0, 0
1, 1, 0
1, 2, 0
```

We can see that the default value of variables type `int` is 0.

We can change the values in the array just like before.
Below we set new values to three elements of the array.

```java
int rows = 2;
int columns = 3;
int[][] twoDimensionalArray = new int[rows][columns];

twoDimensionalArray[0][1] = 4;
twoDimensionalArray[1][1] = 1;
twoDimensionalArray[1][0] = 8;

System.out.println("row, column, value");
for (int row = 0; row < twoDimensionalArray.length; row++) {
    for (int column = 0; column < twoDimensionalArray[row].length; column++) {
        int value = twoDimensionalArray[row][column];
        System.out.println("" + row + ", " + column + ", " + value);
    }
}
```

The program output is as follows:

**Sample Output**
```text
row, column, value
0, 0, 0
1, 0, 4
2, 0, 0
0, 1, 8
1, 1, 1
2, 1, 0
```

### Programming Exercise: Array as a string

Create in the exercise base a method called `public static String arrayAsString(int[][] array)`. It should create a string representation of the array it receives as the parameter and return it.

Brush up on using StringBuilder in part 10.3 before taking on this exercise. Below there are a few examples of how the method is expected to  work.

```java
int rows = 2;
int columns = 3;
int[][] matrix = new int[rows][columns];
matrix[0][1] = 5;
matrix[1][0] = 3;
matrix[1][2] = 7;
System.out.println(arrayAsString(matrix));
```

**Sample Output**
```text
050
307
```

```java
int[][] matrix = {
    {3, 2, 7, 6},
    {2, 4, 1, 0},
    {3, 2, 1, 0}
};

System.out.println(arrayAsString(matrix));
```

**Sample Output**
```text
3276
2410
3210
```

### Programming Exercise: Magic square (4 parts)

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square" target="_blank">Magic squares</a> are squares composed of integers, where the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is the same. Let's practice our array skills and play around with magic squares.

<br/>

In the exercise base there is a partially implemented class called `MagicSquare` that we can use as a basis for our program. Your assignment is to first add functionality to the class so that it can check whether a given square is magical. After this you'll implement an algorithm for creating a magic square.

<h2>Sums of rows</h2>

In the class MagicSquare there is already a method called `public ArrayList<Integer> sumsOfRows()`, which returns an empty ArrayList object. Change the functionality of the method so that it returns a list of sums of every row of the (magic) square.

For example, with the following magic square the `sumOfRows` method should return a list that contains the integers `15, 15, 15`.

```plaintext
8 1 6
3 5 7
4 9 2
```

Even if the magic square is not a "legitimate" magic square, the sums of the rows should still be returned. With the input below, the `sumsOfRows` should return a list with the integer contents `6, 15, 24`.

```plaintext
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

<h2>Sums of columns</h2>

There already exists a stub for the method `public ArrayList<Integer> sumsOfColumns`. At the moment it only returns an empty ArrayList object. Change the functionality of the method so that it returns a list that contains the sums of every column of the magic square.

As an example, when receiving the following magic square the sumsOfColumns should return a list that contains the integers `15, 15, 15`.

```plaintext
8 1 6
3 5 7
4 9 2
```

Even if the magic square is not a "legitimate" magic square, the sum of columns should be returned. In the example below, the sumsOfColumns method should return a list that contains the integers `12, 15, 18`.

```plaintext
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

<h2>Sums of diagonals</h2>

Next, implement the method `public ArrayList<Integer> sumsOfDiagonals()` that returns a list with the sums of the diagonals of a magic square.

With the following magic square, for instance, the method should return a list with the contents `15, 15` (8 + 5 + 2) and (4 + 5 + 6).

```plaintext
8 1 6
3 5 7
4 9 2
```

Even if the square is not a "legitimate" magic square, the sums of the diagonals should still be returned. With the square below, the sumsOfDiagonals should return a list with the integer contents `(15, 15)` (1 + 5 + 9) and (7 + 5 + 3).

```plaintext
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

<h2>Conjuring a magic square</h2>

NB! This part might be quite tricky, so you might want to return the previous sections before beginning it.

It's also possible to create magic squares of your own. Let's familiarize ourselves with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_method" target="_blank">Siamese method</a>. It can be used to create magic squares that have an odd size (as opposed to even).

<br/>

The Siamese method algorithm works in the following manner. You set number one to the centermost column of the top row. After this, we move one row up and one column right, and place number two in this cell. We continue by moving one right, one up, and placing the number 3, etc.

Two rules govern the number placements:

1. If the transition would leave us outside the bounds of the magic square, we jump to the opposite edge. If we go "over the right edge" we continue from the left edge, and if we go "over the top edge" we continue from the bottom.

2. If the place already contains a number, we don't go up and right. Instead we take one step downwards.

Check the visualization for the described algorithm on the Wikipedia page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_method" target="_blank">Siamese method</a>.

<br/>

Implement in the class `MagicSquareFactory` the method `createMagicSquare`. It should return a magic square whose side has the length that is specified as the parameter. The method only needs to work in cases where the width of the square is an odd integer.

> **Array vs. Hash table**
>
> We can implement the same functionality using a hash table. Wouldn't a hash table be a better option, since we do not have to worry about increasing its size at any point?
> 
> 
> 
> When we search for a value of a key from a hash table, we use the hashCode method to find the index to search from.
> There can be multiple values at the same index (on a list). Then we have to compare the key we want to find the value for to the key of each key-value pair on the list using the equals method.
> 
> When we search for a value of a key -- or index -- in an array, we do not have to do any of that.
> 
> An array either contains a certain value or it does not, so there is a small performance beneft on using arrays.
> 
> 
> This performance benefit comes with some added workload and proneness to errors.
> Hash tables have tested and proven functionality for increasing the size of the table. Arrays do not come with this benefit, and when implementing a new functionality we might cause errors which increases the workload.
> However, errors are accepted and natural part of software development.
> 
> 
> When we consider the memory usage, hash tables might -- in some situations -- have some benefits.
> When an array is created, enough memory for the whole array is allocated for it.
> If we do not have values in each element of the array, some of the memory stays unused.
> With hash tables this does not happen -- the size of the hash table is increased only when necessary.
