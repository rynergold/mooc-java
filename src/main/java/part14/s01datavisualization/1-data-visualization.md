The adage "a picture is worth a thousand words" describes the goal of data visualization appropriately. Data visualization seeks to present information in a concise, yet comprehensible form. Visualizations can emphasize important points and provide the user with useful things, such as summaries of data.

The image below shows an application that allows you to view statistics of cyclists. The statistics used have been taken from the  the Helsinki City Planning Agency data set  (CC-BY) found at [https://www.avoindata.fi/data/en/dataset/helsingin-pyorailijamaarat](https://www.avoindata.fi/data/en/dataset/helsingin-pyorailijamaarat).
<br/>

<img src="../img/material/visualisointi-pyorat.png" alt="cyclist data set visualization" />

When comparing the statistics shown in the image to file format - a few lines have been shown below as an example - the benefits are evident. In the original data set the values ​​are presented on an hourly basis, whereas monthly summaries have been generated from the data for the visualization. The original set also contains all of the the places of inspection, whereas in the visualization the user is able to select a specific point.

<pre>
Päivämäärä;Huopalahti (asema);Kaisaniemi;Kulosaaren silta et.;...
ke 1 tammi 2014 00:00;;1;;;;;;2;5;3;;11;;;7;8
ke 1 tammi 2014 01:00;;3;;;;;;6;5;1;;8;;;5;4
ke 1 tammi 2014 02:00;;3;;;;;;1;1;1;;14;;;2;11
ke 1 tammi 2014 03:00;;2;;;;;;0;2;0;;7;;;5;3
...
</pre>

<br/>

Data that's in the format shown above can be processed as strings row by row. The rows are split into pieces that can be processed using a list structure. One way of doing this is the following.

```java
String row = "Päivämäärä;Huopalahti (asema);Kaisaniemi;Kulosaaren silta et.;..."
String[] pieces = row.split(";");
for (int i = 0; i < pieces.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(i + ": " + pieces[i]);
}
```

**Sample Output**
```text
0: Päivämäärä
1: Huopalahti (asema)
2: Kaisaniemi
3: Kulosaaren silta et.
4: ...
```

We'll familiarize ourselves with some patterns used in data visualization, and a technique for visualizing changing data.

## Charts

Java offers [lots of pre-made classes](https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/chart/package-summary.html) for drawing different types of charts. The types of charts include, among others, area charts, bar charts, and line charts.

We are next going to take a look at using both a line and a bar chart. It might be worthwhile to also take a look at Oracle's guide on the subject, which can be found here: [https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/charts/jfxpub-charts.htm](https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/charts/jfxpub-charts.htm).

<br/>

### Line Chart

Line charts can be used to illustrate change that happens over time. The data is illustrated as a line that connects dots in a two-dimencional coordinate system, where the x-axis represents time, and the y-axis the value of the variable at each point in time. A line chart can also contain many different variables.

Let's use a line chart on some real-world data. Statistics Finland offers data on the total votes and relative percentage of votes in the Finnish communal elections for the years 1968-2008. The original data can be found at [https://tilastokeskus.fi/til/kvaa/2008/kvaa_2008_2010-07-30_tau_002.html](https://tilastokeskus.fi/til/kvaa/2008/kvaa_2008_2010-07-30_tau_002.html). A few data points have been drawn from it for visualization purposes -- we'll be focusing on the relative share of the votes here. Our data below uses tabs for separation (i.e., the character '\t').

<br/>

<pre>
Party	1968	1972	1976	1980	1984	1988	1992	1996	2000	2004	2008
KOK	16.1	18.1	20.9	22.9	23.0	22.9	19.1	21.6	20.8	21.8	23.4
SDP	23.9	27.1	24.8	25.5	24.7	25.2	27.1	24.5	23.0	24.1	21.2
KESK	18.9	18.0	18.4	18.7	20.2	21.1	19.2	21.8	23.8	22.8	20.1
VIHR	-	-	-	-	2.8	2.3	6.9	6.3	7.7	7.4	8.9
VAS	16.9	17.5	18.5	16.6	13.1	12.6	11.7	10.4	9.9	9.6	8.8
PS	7.3	5.0	2.1	3.0	5.3	3.6	2.4	0.9	0.7	0.9	5.4
RKP	5.6	5.2	4.7	4.7	5.1	5.3	5.0	5.4	5.1	5.2	4.7
</pre>

It's possible to split one of the rows above in the following manner:

```java
String row = "Party	1968	1972	1976	1980	1984	1988"
List<String> pieces = Arrays.asList(row.split("\t"));
for (int i = 0; i < pieces.size(); i++) {
    System.out.println(i + ": " + pieces.get(i));
}
```

**Sample Output**
```text
0: Party
1: 1968
2: 1972
3: 1976
4: 1980
5: 1984
6: 1988
```

Using a line chart requires that we define the axes of the coordinate system, create the line chart that uses those axes, and insert the data into the line chart. Our first conceptualization of the application is as follows. The progam attempts to visualize the support enjoyed by the RKP party in the years 1968-2008.

```java
@Override
public void start(Stage stage) {
    // create the x and y axes that the chart is going to use
    NumberAxis xAxis = new NumberAxis();
    NumberAxis yAxis = new NumberAxis();

    // set the titles for the axes
    xAxis.setLabel("Year");
    yAxis.setLabel("Relative support (%)");

    // create the line chart. The values of the chart are given as numbers
    // and it uses the axes we created earlier
    LineChart<Number, Number> lineChart = new LineChart<>(xAxis, yAxis);
    lineChart.setTitle("Relative support in the years 1968-2008");

    // create the data set that is going to be added to the line chart
    XYChart.Series rkpData = new XYChart.Series();
    rkpData.setName("RKP");
    // and single points into the data set
    rkpData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(1968, 5.6));
    rkpData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(1972, 5.2));
    rkpData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(1976, 4.7));
    rkpData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(1980, 4.7));
    rkpData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(1984, 5.1));
    rkpData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(1988, 5.3));
    rkpData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(1992, 5.0));
    rkpData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(1996, 5.4));
    rkpData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(2000, 5.1));
    rkpData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(2004, 5.2));
    rkpData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(2008, 4.7));

    // add the data set to the line chart
    lineChart.getData().add(rkpData);

    // display the line chart
    Scene view = new Scene(lineChart, 640, 480);
    stage.setScene(view);
    stage.show();
}
```

When we start the program, we notice a few problems (try it out and see what the data looks like). The class that we've used to create the axes, [NumberAxis](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/chart/NumberAxis.html), happens to offer another constructor as well. You can give the lower and upper bounds as parameters to the constructor, as well as the number of ticks betwen them. Let's set the lower bound as 1968, the upper bound as 2008, and the number of ticks as 4.

<br/>

```java
@Override
public void start(Stage stage) {
    // create the x and y axis
    NumberAxis xAxis= new NumberAxis(1968, 2008, 4);
    // .. the rest of the code stays the same
```

Adding the numbers of support for another party to the program can be done in a similar manner. In the example below, we add the party VIHR to the chart -- the party has been active since the year 1984.

```java
@Override
public void start(Stage stage) {
    // create the x and y axes that the chart is going to use
    NumberAxis xAxis = new NumberAxis();
    NumberAxis yAxis = new NumberAxis();

    // set the titles for the axes
    xAxis.setLabel("Year");
    yAxis.setLabel("Relative support (%)");

    // create the line chart. The values of the chart are given as numbers
    // and it uses the axes we created earlier
    LineChart<Number, Number> lineChart = new LineChart<>(xAxis, yAxis);
    lineChart.setTitle("Relative support in the years 1968-2008");

    // create the data set that is going to be added to the line chart
    XYChart.Series rkpData = new XYChart.Series();
    rkpData.setName("RKP");
    // and single points into the data set
    rkpData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(1968, 5.6));
    rkpData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(1972, 5.2));
    rkpData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(1976, 4.7));
    rkpData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(1980, 4.7));
    rkpData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(1984, 5.1));
    rkpData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(1988, 5.3));
    rkpData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(1992, 5.0));
    rkpData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(1996, 5.4));
    rkpData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(2000, 5.1));
    rkpData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(2004, 5.2));
    rkpData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(2008, 4.7));

    // add the data set to the line chart
    lineChart.getData().add(rkpData);

    // create another data set that's going to be added to the chart
    XYChart.Series vihrData = new XYChart.Series();
    vihrData.setName("VIHR");
    // and single data points into the data set
    vihrData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(1984, 2.8));
    vihrData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(1988, 2.3));
    vihrData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(1992, 6.9));
    vihrData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(1996, 6.3));
    vihrData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(2000, 7.7));
    vihrData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(2004, 7.4));
    vihrData.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(2008, 8.9));

    // add the data set to the line chart
    lineChart.getData().add(vihrData);

    // display the line chart
    Scene view = new Scene(lineChart, 640, 480);
    stage.setScene(view);
    stage.show();
}
```

The program should look like this when started.

<img src="../img/material/chart-support-rkp-and-vihr.png" alt="chart showing support for the rkp and vihr parties"/>

Each data point was manually added above to the program code -- given that we're programmers, this approach feels clumsy. The solution is to read the data into a suitable data structure, after which we can go through the structure and add the data contained in it to the chart. A good candidate for this data structure is a hash map that uses the names of the parties as its keys. The values of the hash table are pairs of numbers that represent the year and the corresponding support number. It's now much more straightforward to add data into the chart.

```java
// the axes and the line chart created previously

// data has been read earlier -- the following object contains the data
Map<String, Map<Integer, Double>> values = // created elsewhere

// go through the parties and add them to the chart
values.keySet().stream().forEach(party -> {
    // a different data set for every party
    XYChart.Series data = new XYChart.Series();
    data.setName(party);

    // add the party's support numbers to the data set
    values.get(party).entrySet().stream().forEach(pair -> {
        data.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(pair.getKey(), pair.getValue()));
    });

    // and add the data set to the chart
    lineChart.getData().add(data);
});
```

### Programming Exercise: Shanghai

Universities are compared yearly. One internationally respected comparer is the Shanghai Ranking Consultancy, which published a yearly comparison list of internationally famous universities. The list also includes the rank for each university. The University of Helsinki has obtained the following ranks in the years 2007-2017:

<pre>
2007 73
2008 68
2009 72
2010 72
2011 74
2012 73
2013 76
2014 73
2015 67
2016 56
2017 56
</pre>

You will find the class `ShangaiApplication` in the exercise base. Create in it a program that shows how the University of Helsinki's ranking has varied during these years. NB! Don't use any layout in the application -- give the line chart object directly as the Scene object's constructor parameter. Also take notice that the Scene also needs the width and height of the displayed area as parameters.

The result drawn by the application could like the following example:

<img src="../img/shanghai.png"/>

### Programming Exercise: Finnish parties

The exercise base contains the class PartiesApplication. Create in it an application that displays the relative support of the major Finnish parties during the years 1968-2008. The project contains the raw data that has been used in the previous examples, and it can be found in the file "partiesdata.tsv".

The relative support must be displayed for each party so that a separate line represents each of them in the line chart. Always set the name of the XYChart.Series object to be the party name that can be found in the data (with the help of the setName method).

When creating the x axis that the line chart uses, take notice that the first year that the statistics cover is the year of 1968.

Tab-separated string can be split into parts in the following manner:

```java
String string = "KOK    16.1    18.1    20.9";
String[] pieces = string.split("\t");
System.out.println(pieces[0]);
System.out.println(pieces[1]);
System.out.println(pieces[2]);
System.out.println(pieces[3]);
```

**Sample Output**
```text
KOK
16.1
18.1
20.9
```

To create a floating point number of a string that contains a floating point number, you can use the valueOf method of the Double class. So for instance `Double.valueOf("16.1");`

The visualization created by the application should look something like this:

<img src="../img/material/chart-relative-support.png" />

&nbsp;

*Data for similar charts can be found in the [PX-Web databases](https://pxnet2.stat.fi/PXWeb/pxweb/fi/StatFin/) of Statistics Finland*

### Programming Exercise: Savings calculator (3 parts)

In this exercise you will implement a program for calculating and displaying the sum in a savings account. User can give the calculator a sum to save each month and the yearly interest rate, and the calculator will display how the savings will increase over 30 years.

<img src="../img/saastolaskuri.png" />

<h2>User interface</h2>

First implement the user interface of the program. The components of the application can be managed using a BorderPane.
In the middle of the BorderPane add a line chart (LineChart), which has two numerical axis (NumberAxis). On the top of the BorderPane add a VBox component which contains two BorderPanes. The first BorderPane (on top) contains the text "Monthly savings" on the left, a slider in the middle and a text describing the slider on the right.
The second BorderPane (below the first one) has the text "Yearly interest rate" on the left, a slider in the middle and a text describing the slider on the right.

You can find tips for using the Slider -class by googling "javafx slider".

Define the Sliders so, that the minimum monthly savings is 25 and the maximum is 250.
The minimum yearly interest rate is 0 and the maximum is 10.
The x-axis of the line chart displays years from 0-30. The y-axis must adapt to the values being shown.

In this phase the application should look like so:

<img src="../img/saastolaskuri-1.png" />

<h2>Displaying the savings</h2>

After the user interface is complete, start implementing the functionality of the program.

Modify the user interface so, that when user changes the sum to save each month (by moving the uppermost slider), the line chart updates to display the savings amount of the new monthly sum. For example when the monthly savings amount is 50, the line chart should have a line showing the values [(0,0), (1,600), (2,1200),(3,1800),...].

In this phase the application should look like so (when the monthly sum to save is 50):

<img src="../img/saastolaskuri-2.png" />

<h2>Displaying the savings and the interest rate</h2>

Modify the user interface so, that it shows the interest rate as well. The line chart should have two lines, one for showing just the monthly savings, and one for showing the monthly savings and the interest rate.

Calculate the interest rate yearly according to the expected  savings at the end of the year. For example when the monthly savings sum is 50 and the yearly interest rate is 5%, the line chart should have a line showing the values [(0,0), (1, 630), (2, 1291.5), (3, 1986,075), ...].

In this phase the application should look like so (when the monthly sum to save is 50 and the yearly interest rate is 10%):

<img src="../img/saastolaskuri-3.png" />

In the chart we see the compound interest of our savings, although with a very optimistic interest rate. When you have completed the application and returned it, you can for example calculate how saving 25 euros a month with 4% yearly interest rate grows over 50 years.

### Bar Charts

Bar charts are used to visualize categorical data. The data is represented as bars --  each bar represents a certain category, and its height (or length) represents the value associated with the category. Examples of data that could well be illustrated with bar charts are populations of countries or the market shares of stores or products.

Let's take a look at using a bar chart to visualize the population figures of the Nordic countries. The used data is from [the Wikipedia article on the Nordic countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_countries) (retrieved 6.12.2019, populations are estimates from the year 2018).

<br/>

<pre>
Iceland, 343518
Norway, 5372191
Sweden, 10313447
Finland, 5537364
Denmark, 5809502
</pre>

We'll use the JavaFx [BarChart] class (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/chart/BarChart.html). As with line charts, the axes have to be defined and data has to be added to the chart. In this case, however, we're going to take advantage of the categorical [CategoryAxis](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/chart/CategoryAxis.html) class to define the x axis. With the CategoryAxis class, the type of the axis values is String. This must also be accounted for in the data that is going to be added to the chart.

<br/>

<pre>
Iceland, 343518
Norway, 5372191
Sweden, 10313447
Finland, 5537364
Denmark, 5809502
</pre>

```java
@Override
public void start(Stage stage) {
    CategoryAxis xAxis = new CategoryAxis();
    NumberAxis yAxis = new NumberAxis();
    BarChart<String, Number> barChart = new BarChart<>(xAxis, yAxis);

    barChart.setTitle("Populations of the Nordic countries");
    barChart.setLegendVisible(false);

    XYChart.Series populations = new XYChart.Series();
    populations.getData().add(new XYChart.Data("Sweden", 10313447));
    populations.getData().add(new XYChart.Data("Denmark", 5809502));
    populations.getData().add(new XYChart.Data("Finland", 5537364));
    populations.getData().add(new XYChart.Data("Norway", 5372191));
    populations.getData().add(new XYChart.Data("Iceland", 343518));

    barChart.getData().add(populations);
    Scene view = new Scene(barChart, 640, 480);
    stage.setScene(view);
    stage.show();
}
```

The source code above produces the following chart.

<img src="../img/material/chart-nordic-countries-populations.png" alt="A bar chart showing the populations of the Nordic countries"/>

As you notice, since the x-axis is defined with the CategoryAxis class, the chart follows the order in which the categories are supplied to the program. In the previous example, the countries were ordered by population. Try to modify the program so that the chart orders the Nordic countries by name. After launching the application you may be able to understand why this form of visualization is hardly used...

### Programming Exercise: Unfair Advertisement

According to the old saying "There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics.", nothing lies like a statistic. The saying might not be completely wrong, as some statistics are purposefully made difficult to read.

The application in the exercise template opens a visualization used for marketing for an imaginary company. The visualization displays the speed of their internet, and shows a remarkable difference to their competitors.

<img src="../img/material/kuvaaja-liittyman-nopeus.png" />

The comparison however is not really fair, and gives the wrong impression on the situation. Modify the program so, that the comparison is fairer.

This exercise has no automatic tests or model answer, so you can define the comparison with some freedom.

### Programming Exercise: Cycling statistics

In the exercise base there is a ready application that illustrates cycling statistics as a line chart. Modify the program so that it uses a bar chart instead of the line chart. All the references to line charts must be removed in the course of the editing.

## Visualizing Dynamic Data

Software is also used to visualize contunually changing information. As an example, the software used to track share prices is constantly searching for the latest share prices and displaying that information to the user. Similarly, weather software retrieves data from stations and displays the most recent information to the user. Software developed for monitoring server-side software works in the same way by pinging the various parts of the server-side software at certain intervals to check for responses.

The [AnimationTimer](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/animation/AnimationTimer.html) class can also be used to visualize dynamic data. The AnimationTimer class can be used to create an application that periodically retrieves or creates new information for the application.
<br/>

The example below illustrates [the large numbers law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larger_numbers_Law). This law is a phenomenon related to probability calculus, which says that the average of a random variable approaches the expected value of the random variable as the number of iterations increases. In practice, for example, the average of rolls of a six-sided dice approaches 3.5 as the number of rolls increases. In the same way, when a coin is thrown the heads-to-tails ratio approaches a "fifty-fifty" split as the number of coin throws increases.
<br/>

```java
@Override
public void start(Stage stage) {
    // The class Random is used to randomize the dice rolls
    Random random = new Random();

    NumberAxis xAxis = new NumberAxis();
    // y-axes represents the average of the rolls. The average is always between [1-6]
    NumberAxis yAxis = new NumberAxis(1, 6, 1);

    LineChart<Number, Number> lineChart = new LineChart<>(xAxis, yAxis);
    // removing elements of the chart, e.g. circles on points
    lineChart.setLegendVisible(false);
    lineChart.setAnimated(false);
    lineChart.setCreateSymbols(false);

    // we create a variable representing the data and add it to the chart
    XYChart.Series average = new XYChart.Series();
    lineChart.getData().add(average);

    new AnimationTimer() {
        private long previous;
        private long sum;
        private long count;

        @Override
        public void handle(long current) {
            if (current - previous < 100_000_000L) {
                return;
            }

            previous = current;

            // roll the dice
            int number = random.nextInt(6) + 1;

            // we grow the sum and increment the count
            sum += number;
            count++;

            // we add a new data point to the chart
            average.getData().add(new XYChart.Data(count, 1.0 * sum / count));
        }
    }.start();

    Scene scene = new Scene(lineChart, 400, 300);
    stage.setScene(scene);
    stage.show();
}
```

The image below shows an example of the application in use. The dice has been rolled nearly a 100 times in it.

<img src="../img/material/kaavio-suurten-lukujen-laki.png" alt="A chart illustrating the law of large numbers"/>

Eagle-eyed readers may have noticed that the application's source code did not re-draw the chart as data was added. What on earth?

Charts such as LineChart and BarChart use a data structure that implements the [ObservableList](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/collections/ObservableList.html) interface to store internal data. Collections that implement the ObservableList interface provide the ability to listen to changes in collections. When a new record is added to the list, such as a new data point for the mean, the list informs all of the objects listening to changes on the list of this change. Charts such as LineChart and BarChart are constructed internally in a way that they listen to changes in the information that they display. If the data changes, the chart is updated automatically.

In some situations we may only want to display the 100 most recent observations of the dynamically changing data. This can be done in the previous example by turning off the random value generation representing the x-axis of the NumberAxis object (the method setAutoRanging(false)), and by adding the following check to the end of the handle method of the AnimationTimer class.

```java
if (average.getData().size() > 100) {
    average.getData().remove(0);
