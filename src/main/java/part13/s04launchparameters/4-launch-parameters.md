The JavaFx applications in the examples have so far been launched by the main method of the class that inherits the Application class. Let's take a brief look at launching applications from outside of the `Application` class. Let's assume that we have the following simple JavaFx for our use.

```java
package application;

import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class JavaFxApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage window) {
        window.setTitle("Hello World!");
        window.show();
    }
}
```

The application can be launched from outside the class by using the `launch` method provided by the `Application` class. A separate class `Main` launches the application in the example below.

```java
package application;

import javafx.application.Application;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
      Application.launch(JavaFxApplication.class);
  }
}
```

When the `main` method of the class above is executed, the user interface defined by the class `JavaFxApplication` is launched.

The application can also be provided run-time parameters as part of the `launch` method. In addition to the lauched class, the `launch` method can be provided an unlimited number of strings that can be used as part of the launch. These strings are available during the application's launch via the `getParameters` method call.

The `getParameters` method returns a [Parameters] (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/application/Application.Parameters.html) type object whose method `getNamed` can access a hash table containing key-value pairs. The key-value pairs are given to the launch method in the form `--key = value`. In the example below, the title is made up of two parameters: `organization` and `course`.

```java
package application;

import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.application.Application.Parameters;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class JavaFxApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage window) {
        Parameters params = getParameters();
        String organization = params.getNamed().get("organization");
        String course = params.getNamed().get("course");

        window.setTitle(organization + ": " + course);
        window.show();
    }
}
```

Launching an application now with the following class sets the application's title to "Once upon a time: Title".

```java
package application;

import javafx.application.Application;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Application.launch(JavaFxApplication.class,
            "--organization=Once upon a time",
            "--course=Title");
    }
}
```

 Parameters could be used to tell the program, for instance, the name of the file used to store and load persons, or even a web address.

### Programming Exercise: User's title

Write a program that asks for a title in a command line interface. When the user types the title and presses enter, the user is shown a graphical user interface with the given title.

Notice, this exercise does not have automatic tests. Return the program once it works as described in the exercise.
