Thus far our graphical interfaces have always included only one view. Next, we'll become familiar with user interfaces containing multiple views.

Generally the views are created as Scene-objects and the transitioning between them happens with events bound to the application. The example below has two Scene objects which both have their own content and an event related to the content. Instead of having an object for laying out components (such as BorderPane) in the example Scene objects, both objects have just one user interface component.

```java
package application;

import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.control.Button;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class BackAndForthApplication extends Application {

  @Override
  public void start(Stage window) {

      Button back = new Button("Back ..");
      Button forth = new Button(".. forth.");

      Scene first = new Scene(back);
      Scene second = new Scene(forth);

      back.setOnAction((event) -> {
          window.setScene(second);
      });

      forth.setOnAction((event) -> {
          window.setScene(first);
      });

      window.setScene(first);
      window.show();
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
      launch(BackAndForthApplication.class);
  }
}
```

Starting the application above creates a user interface where one can transition from a view to another with the press of a button.

### Programming Exercise: Multiple views

There is a class called MultipleViews in the exercise template. Create in it an application that contains three separate views. The views are as follows:

- The layout of the first view is done with the help of the BorderPane class. At the top there is the text "First view!". The center of the view contains a button with the text "To the second view!". By pressing that button the application swithces to the second view.

- The layout of the second view is done with the help of the VBox class. The first element in the layout is a button with the text "To the third view!" in it -- by pressing the button the application switches to the third view. The button is followed by the text "Second view!".

- The third view uses the GridPane class for its layout. At the coordinates (0, 0) there is a text that reads "Third view!". At coordinates (1, 1) there is a button with the text "To the first view!". Pressing this button brings back the first view.

When first started, the program should display the first view.

## Own layout for each view

Let's get familiar with an example containing two different views. In the first view user is asked to input a password. If the user types a wrong password, the application informs the user about the mistake. If the user types the correct password, the application switches to the next view. The program functions as follows:

<img src="../img/material/gui-salasana.gif" />

Switching between views happens like in the previous example. The concrete switching event has been bound to the login button. When pressing the button, the application checks the password typed to the password field -- here we're hoping that the user writes "password". If the password is correct, the view of the window is changed. In our example the view only includes the text "Welcome, this is the beginning!".

```java
package application;

import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.geometry.Insets;
import javafx.geometry.Pos;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.control.Button;
import javafx.scene.control.Label;
import javafx.scene.control.PasswordField;
import javafx.scene.layout.GridPane;
import javafx.scene.layout.StackPane;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class PasswordProtectedApplication extends Application {

  @Override
  public void start(Stage window) throws Exception {

      // 1. Creating the view for asking a password

      // 1.1 Creating components to be used
      Label instructionText = new Label("Write the password and press Log in");
      PasswordField passwordField = new PasswordField();
      Button startButton = new Button("Log in");
      Label errorMessage = new Label("");

      // 1.2 creating layout and adding components to it
      GridPane layout = new GridPane();

      layout.add(instructionText, 0, 0);
      layout.add(passwordField, 0, 1);
      layout.add(startButton, 0, 2);
      layout.add(errorMessage, 0, 3);

      // 1.3 styling the layout
      layout.setPrefSize(300, 180);
      layout.setAlignment(Pos.CENTER);
      layout.setVgap(10);
      layout.setHgap(10);
      layout.setPadding(new Insets(20, 20, 20, 20));

      // 1.4 creating the view itself and setting it to use the layout
      Scene passwordView = new Scene(layout);

      // 2. Creating a view for showing the welcome message
      Label welcomeText = new Label("Welcome, this is the beginning!");

      StackPane welcomeLayout = new StackPane();
      welcomeLayout.setPrefSize(300, 180);
      welcomeLayout.getChildren().add(welcomeText);
      welcomeLayout.setAlignment(Pos.CENTER);

      Scene welcomeView = new Scene(welcomeLayout);

      // 3. Adding an event handler to the login button.
      // The view is changed if the password is right.
      startButton.setOnAction((event) -> {
          if (!passwordField.getText().trim().equals("password")) {
              errorMessage.setText("Unknown password!");
              return;
          }

          window.setScene(welcomeView);
      });

      window.setScene(passwordView);
      window.show();
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
      launch(PasswordProtectedApplication.class);
  }
}
```

The example takes advantage of GridPane's and StackPane's built in setPrefSize and setAlignment methods for layout. Method setPrefSize takes the preferred size of the layout as an argument and the setAlignment method is used to define how the content of the layout should be aligned. The parameter Pos.CENTER is used to place the content in the center of the application

### Programming Exercise: Greeter

In the exercise template there is a class called GreeterApplication. Create in it an application with two views. The first view should have a text field that's used to ask for the user's name. The second view then shows the user a greeting text. The greeting should be of the form "Welcome name!" where the user's name is inserted in place of 'name'.

An example of how the program should work:

<img src="../img/material/gui-greeter.gif" alt="A name is entered into the text field, and the button is pressed. The view changes, and the text 'Welcome <name>!' appears"/>

## Views with the same main alignment

Sometimes one wants an application to have a permanent view whose parts are swapped when needed. Typically applications that have some kind of menus function in this manner.

In the example below, there is a application which contains a main menu and an area with variable content. When pressing the buttons on the main menu the the content of the content area changes.

```java
package application;

import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.geometry.Insets;
import javafx.geometry.Pos;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.control.Button;
import javafx.scene.control.Label;
import javafx.scene.layout.BorderPane;
import javafx.scene.layout.HBox;
import javafx.scene.layout.StackPane;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class ExampleApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage window) throws Exception {

        // 1. Create main layout
        BorderPane layout = new BorderPane();

        // 1.1. Create menu for main layout
        HBox menu = new HBox();
        menu.setPadding(new Insets(20, 20, 20, 20));
        menu.setSpacing(10);

        // 1.2. Create buttons for menu
        Button first = new Button("First");
        Button second = new Button("Second");

        // 1.3. Add buttons to menu
        menu.getChildren().addAll(first, second);

        layout.setTop(menu);

        // 2. Add subviews and add them to the menu buttons
        // 2.1. Create subview layout
        StackPane firstLayout = createView("First view");
        StackPane secondLayout = createView("Second view");

        // 2.2. Add subviews to button. Pressing the buttons will change the view
        first.setOnAction((event) -> layout.setCenter(firstLayout));
        second.setOnAction((event) -> layout.setCenter(secondLayout));

        // 2.3. Set initial view
        layout.setCenter(firstLayout);

        // 3. Create main scene with layout 
        Scene scene = new Scene(layout);

        // 4. Show the main scene
        window.setScene(scene);
        window.show();
    }

    private StackPane createView(String text) {

        StackPane layout = new StackPane();
        layout.setPrefSize(300, 180);
        layout.getChildren().add(new Label(text));
        layout.setAlignment(Pos.CENTER);

        return layout;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(ExampleApplication.class);
    }
}
```

The program functions as follows:

<img src="../img/material/gui-nakyman-vaihto.gif" alt="Application which contains a menu. By pressing the buttons in the menu on is able to change the content of the applivation."/>

### Programming Exercise: Joke

Use the class JokeApplication that is provided with the exercise template to create a program that explains a joke. The application offers a menu consisting of three buttons, and the contents that can be changed by clicking on these buttons. The first button (containing the text "Joke") shows a question that is related to a joke. The second button (text "Answer") show the related answer. The third and the final button ("Explanation") brings up the explanation for the joke.

By default (when it starts) the program should show a joke-related question. Use the following string as the question: "What do you call a bear with no teeth?". The answer should be "A gummy bear." You can come up with a suitable explanation by yourself.

## Separating application logic and user interface logic

Keeping the application logic and user interface logic in the same class or in the same classes is usually a bad idea. It makes testing and editing the application considerably more difficult and also makes the source code harder to read. The principle "Each class should have only one clear responsibility" applies well here too.

Let's inspect separating application logic from user interface logic. Let's suppose that we have an object using the following interface and we want to create a user interface for saving applications.

```java
public interface PersonWarehouse {
    void save(Person person);
    Person search(String socialSecurityNumber);

    void delete(Person person);
    void delete(String socialSecurityNumber);
    void deleteAll();

    Collection<Person> getAll();
}
```

When implementing a user interface a good starting point is drawing the interface followed by adding appropriate user interface components to the user interface. When saving persons to a database we need a field for name, a field for social security number and a button for adding the person. In addition we'll also create

Lets use `GridPane` class for the layout. There are 3 rows and 2 columns in the user interface. We'll add the event handling later. The initialization method is as follows:

```java
@Override
public void start(Stage window) {

    Label nameText = new Label("Name: ");
    TextField nameField = new TextField();
    Label secText = new Label("Social security number: ");
    TextField secField = new TextField();

    Button addButton = new Button("Add person!");

    GridPane components = new GridPane();
    components.add(nameText, 0, 0);
    components.add(nameField, 1, 0);
    components.add(secText, 0, 1);
    components.add(secField, 1, 1);
    components.add(addButton, 1, 2);

    // Add some style to the ui
    components.setHgap(10);
    components.setVgap(10);
    components.setPadding(new Insets(10, 10, 10, 10));

    Scene scene = new Scene(components);

    window.setScene(scene);
    window.show();
}
```

<img src="../img/material/gui-lisaa-henkilo.png" alt="Two text fields and a button"/>

Next lets add an object that implements the ActionEvent interface that adds field values to PersonWarehouse interface.

```java
@Override
public void start(Stage window) {
    // ...

    addButton.setOnAction((event) -> {
        warehouse.save(new Person(nameText.getText(), secText.getText());
    });
    // ...
}
```

But where do we get the actual PersonWarehouse-object? It is created at the beginning of the start method. Below is the code in whole.

```java

import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.geometry.Insets;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.control.Button;
import javafx.scene.control.Label;
import javafx.scene.control.TextField;
import javafx.scene.layout.GridPane;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class PersonApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage window) {
        PersonWarehouse warehouse = new MyPersonWarehouse();

        Label nameText = new Label("Name: ");
        TextField nameField = new TextField();
        Label secText = new Label("Social security number: ");
        TextField secField = new TextField();

        Button addButton = new Button("Add person!");

        addButton.setOnAction((event) -> {
            warehouse.save(new Person(nameText.getText(), secText.getText());
        });

        GridPane components = new GridPane();
        components.add(nameText, 0, 0);
        components.add(nameField, 1, 0);
        components.add(secText, 0, 1);
        components.add(secField, 1, 1);
        components.add(addButton, 1, 2);

        // Add some style to the ui
        components.setHgap(10);
        components.setVgap(10);
        components.setPadding(new Insets(10, 10, 10, 10));

        Scene scene = new Scene(components);

        window.setScene(scene);
        window.show();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(PersonApp.class);
    }
}
```

## A slightly larger application: Vocabulary practice

Let's outline an application that can be used to practise vocabulary of a foreign language. The application offers two features to the user: entering words and their translations, and practising with the stored words. We'll create four different classes for the application: the first class offers the core logic, i.e. maintaining a dictionary; second and third classes contain the entering view and the practice view; and the fourth class contains the main menu and the functionality required to start the application.

### Dictionary

The dictionary is going to be implemented with the help of a hash map and a list. The hash map contains the words and their translations, and the list is used to randomly choose the word for practice. The class has the necessary methods for adding a translation, for fetching a translation, and for drawing a random word.

```java
package application;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Random;

public class Dictionary {

    private List<String> words;
    private Map<String, String> translations;

    public Dictionary() {
        this.words = new ArrayList<>();
        this.translations = new HashMap<>();

        add("sana", "word");
    }

    public String get(String word) {
        return this.translations.get(word);
    }

    public void add(String word, String translation) {
        if (!this.translations.containsKey(word)) {
            this.words.add(word);
        }

        this.translations.put(word, translation);
    }

    public String getRandomWord() {
        Random random = new Random();
        return this.words.get(random.nextInt(this.words.size()));
    }
}
```

You could also implement the Dictionary so that returning a random word would always generate a new list of words from the keys of the translations hash map. In such a case there would be no need to maintaing a separate list of words. However, this would have an effect on the performance of the program (or it would have had an effect before the turn of the millennium -- computers these days are a tad faster...).

### Entering new words

Next we'll shape the functionality that's needed for entering words. In order for us to do that, we're going to need a reference to the dictionary object, and text fields for the word and its translation. The GridPane layout works well for the fields. Let's create a class called InputView. It contains the method getView that creates the view necessary for entering new words. This method should return a reference to a [Parent](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/Parent.html) type object. Parent is a superclass to many classes, among them all the classes used for layouts. Therefore any layout class can be represented as a Parent object.

The class also defines what happens when a button in the user interface is pressed. When the user clicks the button, the new word is added to the dictionary. The text fields are also cleared so that the next word can be entered.

```java
package applicatoin;

import javafx.geometry.Insets;
import javafx.geometry.Pos;
import javafx.scene.Parent;
import javafx.scene.control.Button;
import javafx.scene.control.Label;
import javafx.scene.control.TextField;
import javafx.scene.layout.GridPane;

public class InputView {

    private Dictionary dictionary;

    public InputView(Dictionary dictionary) {
        this.dictionary = dictionary;
    }

    public Parent getView() {
        GridPane layout = new GridPane();

        Label wordInstruction = new Label("Word");
        TextField wordField = new TextField();
        Label translationInstruction = new Label("Translation");
        TextField translationField = new TextField();

        layout.setAlignment(Pos.CENTER);
        layout.setVgap(10);
        layout.setHgap(10);
        layout.setPadding(new Insets(10, 10, 10, 10));

        Button addButton = new Button("Add the word pair");

        layout.add(wordInstruction, 0, 0);
        layout.add(wordField, 0, 1);
        layout.add(translationInstruction, 0, 2);
        layout.add(translationField, 0, 3);
        layout.add(addButton, 0, 4);

        addButton.setOnMouseClicked((event) -> {
            String word = wordField.getText();
            String translation = translationField.getText();

            dictionary.add(word, translation);

            wordField.clear();
            translationField.clear();
        });

        return layout;
    }
}
```

### Vocabulary training

Now we shall create the functionality to practise mastery of the stored words. We are going to need a reference to a dictionary object, so that we have a source for the words used for practice and so that we can check whether the translation is correct. In addition to the dictionary, we are going to need a text component that informs the user of which word to translate, and a text field where the translation can be placed. GridPane works well enough to handle the layout of the fields in this case, too.

The translated word at each time is an object variable of the class. The object variable can be used and changed also in the method that is defined in the context of an event handler.

```java
package application;

import javafx.geometry.Insets;
import javafx.geometry.Pos;
import javafx.scene.Parent;
import javafx.scene.control.Button;
import javafx.scene.control.Label;
import javafx.scene.control.TextField;
import javafx.scene.layout.GridPane;

public class PracticeView {

    private Dictionary dictionary;
    private String word;

    public PracticeView(Dictionary dictionary) {
        this.dictionary = dictionary;
        this.word = dictionary.getRandomWord();
    }

    public Parent getView() {
        GridPane layout = new GridPane();

        Label wordInstruction = new Label("Translate the word '" + this.word + "'");
        TextField translationField = new TextField();

        layout.setAlignment(Pos.CENTER);
        layout.setVgap(10);
        layout.setHgap(10);
        layout.setPadding(new Insets(10, 10, 10, 10));

        Button addButton = new Button("Check");

        Label feedback = new Label("");

        layout.add(wordInstruction, 0, 0);
        layout.add(translationField, 0, 1);
        layout.add(addButton, 0, 2);
        layout.add(feedback, 0, 3);

        addButton.setOnMouseClicked((event) -> {
            String translation = translationField.getText();
            if (dictionary.get(word).equals(translation)) {
                feedback.setText("Correct!");
            } else {
                feedback.setText("Incorrect! The translation fo the word '" + word + "' is '" + dictionary.get(word) + "'.");
                return;
            }

            this.word = this.dictionary.getRandomWord();
            wordInstruction.setText("Translate the word '" + this.word + "'");
            translationField.clear();
        });

        return layout;
    }
}
```

### Practice application

The practice application both unites the previously created classes and offers the main menu of the application. The structure of the practice application is as follows.

```java
package application;

import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.geometry.Insets;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.control.Button;
import javafx.scene.layout.BorderPane;
import javafx.scene.layout.HBox;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class PracticeApplication extends Application {

    private Dictionary dictionary;

    @Override
    public void init() throws Exception {
        // 1. Create the dictionary that the application uses
        this.dictionary = new Dictionary();
    }

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {
        // 2. Create the views ("subviews")
        PracticeView practiceView = new PracticeView(dictionary);
        InputView inputView = new InputView(dictionary);

        // 3. Create the higher level layout
        BorderPane layout = new BorderPane();

        // 3.1. Create the menu for the general layout
        HBox menu = new HBox();
        menu.setPadding(new Insets(20, 20, 20, 20));
        menu.setSpacing(10);

        // 3.2. Create the menu buttons
        Button enterButton = new Button("Enter new words");
        Button practiceButton = new Button("Practice");

        // 3.3. Add the buttons to the menu
        menu.getChildren().addAll(enterButton, practiceButton);
        layout.setTop(menu);

        // 4. Connect the subviews with the buttons. Clicking menu buttons changes the subview.
        enterButton.setOnAction((event) -> layout.setCenter(inputView.getView()));
        practiceButton.setOnAction((event) -> layout.setCenter(practiceView.getView()));

        // 5. First show the input view
        layout.setCenter(inputView.getView());

        // 6. Create the main view and add the high level layout
        Scene view = new Scene(layout, 400, 300);

        // 7. Show the application
        stage.setScene(view);
        stage.show();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(PracticeApplication.class);
    }
}
```

### Programming Exercise: Vocabulary practice

In this exercise you are going to create the previously described application to practise new vocabulary. The application should start when the main method of the VocabularyPracticeApplication is executed.

Follow the previous example and create an application for practising translations. The application should offer two views. In the first view the user can enter words and their translations into the program. In the second view the user is asked to translate different words. The words to be translated should be randomly selected from among all the words that have been entered into the program.

Let's discuss the user interface in more detail. The button that shows the input view should contain the text "Enter new words". The button that shows the practice view should contain the text "Practice". In the input view, the first text field should have the word in the original language, and the second text field should contain the translation of that word. The button that adds this word and the translation should read "Add the word pair". In the practice view the user is presented with a word in the original language, and their task is to write down the translation. If the answer is correct, the user interface displays the text "Correct!". If the answer is incorrect, the text that is displayed is "Incorrect!". In this case the correct translation is also shown.

<img src="../img/material/gui-vocabulary-practice.gif"/>

There are no automatic tests in this project -- return your solution when the program works in the way described above. The model solution contains an initial sketch of a possible solution to create statistics. This is not essential for the purposes of this exercise, so there is no need to find these elements in your answer.

### Programming Exercise: Tic-tac-toe (3 parts)

In this exercise you will create a tic-tac-toe game of size 3x3. The assignment has been divided into three parts: first we create the parts of the user interface, then the funcionality of the buttons, and finally the option to play the game to conclusion.

<img src="../img/exercises/tic-tac-toe.png" alt="3x3 tic-tac-toe" />

NB! You can make the characters in the buttons to be equally large with a suitable font selection. The font that the buttons in the screenshot use has been set in the following manner:

```java
Button btn = new Button(" ");
btn.setFont(Font.font("Monospaced", 40));
```

<h2>User interface</h2>

Modify the TicTacToeApplication class so that it starts the graphical user interface. First, use the BorderPane class to create the layout of the UI components. The top of the BorderPane should contain a text component that includes information about the turn, and at the end of the game a message to show that the game has ended. In the middle of the BorderPane create a GridPane that contains 9 buttons. The GridPane should have 3 rows and 3 columns, so that the buttons form a 3x3 grid.

<h2>Taking turns and fair play</h2>

The players of the game are X and O. X always takes the first turn. Add the following functionality to the buttons: when a button is pressed, the game updates so that symbol of the current player (X if it was X's turn when the button was pressed) is stored in the button. After this the other player gets their turn.

The text component at the top of the game must always show whose turn it is. The text begins as "Turn: X". Once X finishes their turn by pressing a button, the text should change to "Turn: O". After player O has finished their turn, the text should turn into "Turn: X" again.

NB! If a player has already placed their symbol in a position, the other player cannot choose the same position. Make sure that the turn doesn't change if a player tries to choose a position that already contains a symbol.

NB!! You might encounter the following error: "local variables referenced from a lambda expression must be final or effectively final". This is because objects instanced of interfaces cannot use variables that are defined outside of the method. You can avoid the error by creating new variables that you set the problematic values to just before using them in the method.

<h2>Finishing the game</h2>

Add the possibility to finish the game to the program. The game ends if one player positions three of their symbols in a line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The end of the game should be indicated by the text "The end!" at the top of the program. It should be no longer possible to continue the game after this.

The tests of this exercise are not the most detailed ones. Try to create the program without relying on the tests too much.
